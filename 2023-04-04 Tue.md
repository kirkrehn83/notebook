=================================
Base system (basesystem)
=================================

[INFO] Server hardware architecture is bare-metal arm64
  - Server model is Raspberry Pi 400 Rev 1.0

[INFO] Server is running Linux kernel 5.15.76-v8+

[INFO] Server is running Debian 11.6

[INFO] Server is running YunoHost 11.1.16 (stable)
  - yunohost version: 11.1.16 (stable)
  - yunohost-admin version: 11.1.8 (stable)
  - moulinette version: 11.1.4 (stable)
  - ssowat version: 11.1.4 (stable)



=================================
Internet connectivity (ip)
=================================

[SUCCESS] Domain name resolution is working!

[SUCCESS] The server is connected to the Internet through IPv4!
  - Global IP: xx.xx.xx.xx
  - Local IP: 192.168.50.136

[WARNING] The server does not have working IPv6.
  - Having a working IPv6 is not mandatory for your server to work, but it is better for the health of the Internet as a whole. IPv6 should usually be automatically configured by the system or your provider if it's available. Otherwise, you might need to configure a few things manually as explained in the documentation here: https://yunohost.org/#/ipv6. If you cannot enable IPv6 or if it seems too technical for you, you can also safely ignore this warning.

[SUCCESS] Port 25 is reachable from the outside.
  - Exposing this port is needed for email features (service postfix)

[ERROR] Port 53 is not reachable from the outside.
  - Exposing this port is needed for [?] features (service adguardhome)
  - To fix this issue, you most probably need to configure port forwarding on your internet router as described in https://yunohost.org/isp_box_config

[SUCCESS] Port 80 is reachable from the outside.
  - Exposing this port is needed for web features (service nginx)

[SUCCESS] Port 443 is reachable from the outside.
  - Exposing this port is needed for web features (service nginx)

[SUCCESS] Port 587 is reachable from the outside.
  - Exposing this port is needed for email features (service postfix)

Email (mail)
=================================

[SUCCESS] The SMTP mail server is able to send emails (outgoing port 25 is not blocked).

[SUCCESS] The SMTP mail server is reachable from the outside and therefore is able to receive emails!

[ERROR] Reverse DNS is not correctly configured for IPv4. Some emails may fail to get delivered or be flagged as spam.
  - Current reverse DNS: 166.sub-75-226-164.myvzw.com
    Expected value: maindomain.tld
  - You should first try to configure reverse DNS with maindomain.tld in your internet router interface or your hosting provider interface. (Some hosting providers may require you to send them a support ticket for this).
  - Some providers won't let you configure your reverse DNS (or their feature might be broken...). If you are experiencing issues because of this, consider the following solutions:
     - Some ISP provide the alternative of using a mail server relay though it implies that the relay will be able to spy on your email traffic.
    - A privacy-friendly alternative is to use a VPN *with a dedicated public IP* to bypass this kind of limits. See https://yunohost.org/#/vpn_advantage
    - Or it's possible to switch to a different provider

[ERROR] Your IP or domain xx.xx.xx.xx is blacklisted on Spamhaus ZEN
  - The blacklist reason is: "https://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/xx.xx.xx.xx"
  - After identifying why you are listed and fixing it, feel free to ask for your IP or domain to be removed on https://www.spamhaus.org/zen/

[SUCCESS] 0 pending emails in the mail queues
